% kenny, put a section here about B+ algorithms

The UI portion of this project requires a sizable amount of
algorithmic work. The most difficult factor is the development of a
node layout algorithm that prevents node overlap, while also giving an
ideal spacing between the nodes in the tree. This is especially
important as the size of the tree grows.

A popular method for solving this problem is the use of the
force-based algorithm. This algorithm works well for spreading nodes
out over 2 or 3 dimensional space. However, it does not take into
account the movement limitations that are imposed in a B+
tree. Namely, the nodes in a B+ tree can only move horizontally except
for in the case of a node split or join. This limitation requires
non-trivial modifications to the algorithm.

A secondary issue with the use of force-based algorithms is that they
have a running time of O$(n^3)$. This
