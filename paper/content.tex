\begin{abstract}
B Trees and B+ Trees are tree structures used for the efficient
storage and retrieval of key/value pairs. Both data structures are
heavily used in the field of Computer Science for a wide variety of
applications. In this project, we devise a new learning tool for
students to better understand the operations performed by B and B+ Trees.
