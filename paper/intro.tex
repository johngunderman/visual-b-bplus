Our project aims to create a visualization of B and B+ trees using HTML5
technologies such as the \textit{canvas} element and Javascript. The user will open the
webpage and be presented with an interface that allows them to insert, delete
and search through these structures, with a visualization of how the
operations are performed.

B and B+ Trees are important data structures to be familiar with for
anyone working in the field of Computer Science. While literature on
the data structures is extensive, there does not exist a good
interactive visualization tool for observing the data structures in
action. The few tools that do exist for this purpose are somewhat old
and are written in Java. We found HTML5 and Javascript to be a much
more appealing and accessible language in today's web-connected world,
and thus chose to bring these old visualization tools into the modern day.
